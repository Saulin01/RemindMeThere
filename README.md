# RemindMeThere
Sometimes we forget things we need to do at certain places or miss our bus stop because of falling asleep, this app aims to help by reminding you of your tasks whenever you are near the locations they must be done. It uses googles GeoFence API, and it supports up to 100 reminders per device per user. It requires location permission to work.  At the start you are greeted with the app logo and welcome message.  Click on the location button to jump to your current location. Press the plus button to add a reminder. This takes you to another activity here you select the center location after hitting continue you need to select the radius within which you will be notified. If you are already at the location you just selected it will not go off immediately. After that you write a message that will be shown on notification. You can see all the active notification areas in the map as bluish circles. If you want to remove any of the notification click on it and a message will pop up asking if you really want to remove the reminder. Upon clicking yes the reminder will be removed. Following are some of the screenshots of the app.
